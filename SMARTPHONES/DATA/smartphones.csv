 (3),"It didnt meet my expectations. It has a different charger terminal rather than the common one for  android phones, even with the connector for headphones, its just additional items that one has to carry in order to use the phone. 
The hands free has low volume at its max. I haven't figured out to date how to expand the memory with a card.
The camera is excellent!"

 (18),"Jumia's return policy is a throw... don't be fooled by the 7-day return policy. This phone had issues with hanging, every time I could call someone the phone could hang or they could fail to hear me from the other end. I decided to take it back. The return policy is based on the quality management team that based my claims on a five minutes call that they say they used to invalidate my claims. So just because the phone didn't hang or disconnect during the five minutes call they made to assess the ""quality"" of the phone it makes my claim that the phone was hanging invalid. Yet, I had used that phone for two days and had issues with it hanging up and dropping. The google duo couldn't work too. I can't have bought a phone for 20K plus to just return it because of an invalid claim. This is too disappointing!!!!"
 (8),"I bought this product following an outbid by Jumia through shake & win, which turned out to be a fake, suddenly hoping to recover 50% cash-back I rushed to acquire a smartphone and a tablet, at the end of it Jumia won, my wallet balance remained at 0 KES, suddenly, I stopped ordering on Jumia, but I continue to eat with FoodJumia"
