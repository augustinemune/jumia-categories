 (14),Just what I ordered
 (17),"I have had plenty of Bluetooth devices. If you know the kind. ""Ze blutooz dewis is weddy to peyaaaa.""
This is not that kind of device. It's surprisingly bigger than I expected. It is impressive in it's loudness. Keep in mind this is not a music system it's a domestic use speaker. It's so perfect when I'm doing chores around the house I just strap it on my belt and walk with the party. 
Connection is seamless. Range is reasonable believe me. And the sound quality is supreme. 
I recommend."
